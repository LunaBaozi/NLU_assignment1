# Natural Language Understanding - Assignment 1

This repository contains the material required to complete the first assignment of the Natural Language Understanding course. It is composed of:
1. A .py file;
2. A README.md file;
3. A .ipynb notebook.

## Requirements

In order to run the code, you need to install `spacy` via the package manager [pip] or another preferred method.


## Usage
The collection of functions makes use of the main `spaCy` objects and methods for dependency parsing. Detailed comments on the rationale behind each specific function can be found on the .py file itself. The code can be simply executed via:

```bash
python assignment1.py
```

It will output the results of the testing made on the functions.


## Purpose
This repository has the main purpose of fulfilling the requests for the Natural Language Understanding course's first assignment.
